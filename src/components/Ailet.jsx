                            <h3>AILET 2025: Exam Pattern</h3>
                            <p>The AILET for B.A.LL.B (Hons.) program will have three (3) sections of 150 multiple choice questions for 150 marks in total. The duration of the examination is 120 minutes.</p>

                            <p>The three sections are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Section A: English Language (50 questions; 50 marks).</li>
                                <li>Section B: Current Affairs &amp; General Knowledge (30 questions; 30 marks).</li>
                                <li>Section C: Logical Reasoning (70 questions; 70 marks).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Legal principles may be used in the logical reasoning section to test logical aptitude but the examination does not require more than the basic knowledge of legal concepts</p>

                            <h5 class="brand-purple">Marking Scheme and Selection criteria</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Negative marking: </strong>There will be a Negative Marking in AILET. The criteria for negative marking will be based on the formula 0.25*4=1 which means 0.25 marks will be deducted for every wrong answer. Therefore, four wrong answers will lead to a deduction of 1 Mark.</li>
                                <li><strong>Selection criteria:</strong> If two or more candidates get the same marks at the All India Law Entrance Test (AILET), their merit will be determined on the basis of higher marks in the section Logical Reasoning. If the merit is still the same, then the candidate who is senior in age shall get preference. If still there is no change in merit, then the computerized draw of lots shall be taken into consideration.</li>
                            </ul>
